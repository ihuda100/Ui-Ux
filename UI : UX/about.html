        <p class="">
          Apple Inc. is an American multinational technology company
          headquartered in Cupertino, California, United States. Apple is the
          largest technology company by revenue (totaling US$365.8 billion in
          2021) and, as of June 2022, is the world's biggest company by market
          capitalization, the fourth-largest personal computer vendor by unit
          sales and second-largest mobile phone manufacturer. It is one of the
          Big Five American information technology companies, alongside Alphabet
          (Google), Amazon, Meta (Facebook), and Microsoft. <br />
          Apple was founded as Apple Computer Company on April 1, 1976, by Steve
          Wozniak, Steve Jobs and Ronald Wayne to develop and sell Wozniak's
          Apple I personal computer. It was incorporated by Jobs and Wozniak as
          Apple Computer, Inc. in 1977 and the company's next computer, the
          Apple II, became a best seller and one of the first mass-produced
          microcomputers. Apple went public in 1980 to instant financial
          success. The company developed computers featuring innovative
          graphical user interfaces, including the 1984 original Macintosh,
          announced that year in a critically acclaimed advertisement. By 1985,
          the high cost of its products and power struggles between executives
          caused problems. Wozniak stepped back from Apple amicably and pursued
          other ventures, while Jobs resigned bitterly and founded NeXT, taking
          some Apple employees with him. <br />
          As the market for personal computers expanded and evolved throughout
          the 1990s, Apple lost considerable market share to the lower-priced
          duopoly of the Microsoft Windows operating system on Intel-powered PC
          clones (also known as "Wintel"). In 1997, weeks away from bankruptcy,
          the company bought NeXT to resolve Apple's unsuccessful operating
          system strategy and entice Jobs back to the company. Over the next
          decade, Jobs guided Apple back to profitability through a number of
          tactics including introducing the iMac, iPod, iPhone and iPad to
          critical acclaim, launching "Think different" and other memorable
          advertising campaigns, opening the Apple Store retail chain, and
          acquiring numerous companies to broaden the company's product
          portfolio. When Jobs resigned in 2011 for health reasons, and died two
          months later, he was succeeded as CEO by Tim Cook.
